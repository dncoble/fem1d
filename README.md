# fem1d
Python wrapper for FEM1D program from J.N. Reddy. Use this to generate the problem data cards or alternatively solve straight from python. 

I've tried to program this to the full functionality of FEM1D, but it has only been tested with Euler-Bernoulli beam problems.

I couldn't verify the license for FEM1D by J.N. Reddy, although the program is [freely available](https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072466855/student_view0/executables.html) on the McGraw Hill website. Before running the code, download the .exe and place it in [/fem1d](/fem1d).
